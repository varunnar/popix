# Languages

Popix uses the react-native, a mobile version of the react framework, as well as partners with EXPO. The visualizations are originally built in D3, and then modified to work with a react-native environment which does include DOM features

# API

Popix uses the movieGLU API to collect information about local movie theaters, and also uses the The Movie DB (TMDB) API which provides addition information on the movies, such as rating, descriptions and images.
